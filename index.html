            <h3>Systems Engineer at KLA</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently working as a systems engineer at KLA, one of the
              leading providers of metrology and inspection tools for the
              semiconductor industry worldwide.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a systems engineer, I am responsible for maintaining and
              developing a complex electron-beam based metrology system. My work
              involves a wide range of tasks, including writing calibrations and
              scripts for monitoring the tool's behaviour, collaborating with
              cross-functional teams to perform hardware changes and assisting
              in product demos during which we demonstrate our tool's
              performance to potential customers.
              <br /><br />
              In my daily work, I often have to rely on statistical and
              analytical techniques to identify the root causes of a problem.
              This can be a challenging task when we consider that the
              performance specifications of our tool lie in the nm range. To
              move confidently within that range, an in-depth understanding of
              the fundamental physics of the many different subsystems involved,
              is essential.

            <h3>Master of Science at the LMU Munich</h3>
            <p>
              I completed my Master's degree in physics at the Nano-Institute at
              the LMU Munich, where I used Machine Learning for the inverse
              design of achromatic metalenses. Compared to conventional optical
              lenses, metalenses can be made ultrathin since they are made up of
              nanostructures, which can be manufactured with already existing
              micro-fabrication techniques borrowed from the semiconductor
              industry. For a more detailed explanation, you can read my thesis
              <a href="theses/master_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              In a second project, I fabricated chiral metamaterials and later
              on deposited perovskites to observe whether the
              perovskite-specific emission changed through the interaction of
              the metamaterials. It was here throughout the fabrication of these
              nanostructures, that I was introduced to the processes that are
              commonly used in the semiconductor industry such as
              (electron-beam) lithography, chemical vapor deposition and plasma
              etching. You can find the published paper

              <strong>Teaching Assistance at the LMU Munich</strong><br />
              I supervised lab courses for bachelor students in physics,
              medicine and dentistry over the course of four semesters while I
              was writing my Master thesis. This was super fun and made me love
              teaching!

            <p>
              <strong>WARR Rocketry at the TUM</strong><br />
              I worked with students across different engineering disciplines
              (mechanical-, chemical-, aerospace-engineering, computer science
              and physics) on the development of a 5 m long hybrid-fuel based
              rocket. More specifically, I automated tasks in Python and helped
              in moulding the propellant grain into a 3D printed form inside the
              main chamber. While my contributions in that short period were
              little, I still enjoyed and learned a lot from watching the eager
              students working on their passion.

            <h3>Bachelor of Science at the LMU Munich</h3>
            <p>
              I wrote my Bachelor thesis in experimental particle physics on the
              topic "Studies of Interpolation Techniques in the Parameter Space
              of Signal Models for (BSM/SUSY) Searches". <br />
              The motivation for my thesis was the following: simulating
              collision events at the LHC is computationally expensive. In my
              studies, I investigated the feasibility of interpolating between
              existing signal events by testing different interpolation
              algorithms. For a more detailed explanation, you can read my
              thesis

            <h3>Receptionist on the MSC Sinfonia</h3>
            <p>
              After the civil service and before starting university, I briefly
              worked as a receptionist on the Italian Cruise Ship, MSC Sinfonia.
              This was a very valueable experience for me. Not only was I able
              to visit a lot of countries in Europe, but I also learned much
              about customer service and how to keep my cool when being
              confronted with complaints in four different languages.

            <p>
              I completed the civil service at the LKH Gmunden hospital in
              Gmunden, near my home-town in Austria.

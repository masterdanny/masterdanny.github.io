        <h3>KLA</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2022 - now</div>
        <p>
          I am currently working as a systems engineer at KLA, one of the leading providers of metrology and inspection tools for the semiconductor industry worldwide.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a systems engineer, I am responsible for maintaining and developing a complex electron-beam based metrology system. My work involves a wide range of tasks, including writing calibrations and scripts for monitoring the tool's behaviour, collaborating with cross-functional teams to perform hardware changes and assisting in product demos during which we demonstrate our tool's performance to potential customers. In my daily work, I often have to rely on statistical and analytical techniques to identify the root causes of a problem. This can be a challenging task when we consider that the performance specifications of our tool lie in the nm range. To move confidently within that range, an in-depth understanding of the fundamental physics of the many different subsystems involved, is essential.

        <h3>Master of Science</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2018 - 2021</div>
        <p>
          I completed my Master's degree in physics at the Nano-Institute at the LMU Munich, where I used Machine Learning for the inverse design of achromatic metalenses. Compared to conventional optical lenses, metalenses can be made ultrathin since they are made up of nanostructures, which can be manufactured with already existing micro-fabrication techniques from the semiconductor industry. Read my thesis <a href="thesis/">here</a>. <br> <br>
          In a second project, I fabricated chiral metamaterials and later on deposited perovskites to observe whether the perovskite-specific emission changed through the interaction of the metamaterials. It was here throughout the fabrication of these nanostructures, that I was introduced to the processes that are commonly used in the semiconductor industry. You can find the published paper <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00159">here</a>.

          <strong>Teaching Assistance at the LMU Munich.</strong> <br>
          I supervised lab courses for bachelor students in physics, medicine and dentistry over the course of four semesters while I was writing my Master thesis. This was super fun and made me love teaching!
        </p>
        <strong>WARR Rocketry</strong><br>
          <p>I worked with students across different engineering disciplines (mechanical-, chemical-, aerospace-engineering, computer science and physics) on the development of a 5 m long hybrid-fuel based rocket. More specifically, I automated tasks in Python and helped in moulding the propellant grain into a 3D printed form inside the main chamber. While my contributions in that short period were little, I still enjoyed and learned a lot from watching the eager students working on their passion. </p>

        <h3>Bachelor of Science</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2015 - 2018</div>
        <p>
          I wrote my Bachelor thesis in experimental particle physics on the topic "Studies of Interpolation Techniques in the Parameter Space of Signal Models for (BSM/SUSY) Searches". The motivation for my thesis was the following: Simulating collision events at the LHC is computationally expensive. In my studies, I investigated the feasibility of interpolating between existing signal events by testing different interpolation algorithms. Find a copy of my bachelor thesis here.

        <h3>Guest Service Agent</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2015</div>
        <p>
          After the civil service and before starting university, I worked as a Guest Service Agent at the reception on the Italian Cruise Ship, MSC Sinfonia.
        </p>
        <h3>Civil service</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2014 - 2015</div>
        <p>
          I completed the civil service at the LKH Gmunden hospital in Gmunden, near my home-town in Austria.

        <p>
          I am currently working as a systems engineer at KLA, one of the
          leading providers of metrology and inspection tools for the
          semiconductor industry worldwide.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a systems engineer, I am responsible for maintaining and developing
          a complex electron-beam based metrology system. My work involves a
          wide range of tasks, including writing calibrations and scripts for
          monitoring the tool's behaviour, collaborating with cross-functional
          teams to perform hardware changes and assisting in product demos
          during which we demonstrate our tool's performance to potential
          customers. In my daily work, I often have to rely on statistical and
          analytical techniques to identify the root causes of a problem. This
          can be a challenging task when we consider that the performance
          specifications of our tool lie in the nm range. To move confidently
          within that range, an in-depth understanding of the fundamental
          physics of the many different subsystems involved, is essential.

        <h3>Master of Science at the LMU Munich</h3>
        <p>
          I completed my Master's degree in physics at the Nano-Institute at the
          LMU Munich, where I used Machine Learning for the inverse design of
          achromatic metalenses. Compared to conventional optical lenses,
          metalenses can be made ultrathin since they are made up of
          nanostructures, which can be manufactured with already existing
          micro-fabrication techniques borrowed from the semiconductor industry.
          For a more detailed explanation, you can read my thesis
          <a href="thesis/">here</a>. <br />
          <br />
          In a second project, I fabricated chiral metamaterials and later on
          deposited perovskites to observe whether the perovskite-specific
          emission changed through the interaction of the metamaterials. It was
          here throughout the fabrication of these nanostructures, that I was
          introduced to the processes that are commonly used in the
          semiconductor industry such as (electron-beam) lithography, chemical
          vapor deposition and plasma etching. You can find the published paper
          <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00159"

          <strong>Teaching Assistance at the LMU Munich.</strong> <br />
          I supervised lab courses for bachelor students in physics, medicine
          and dentistry over the course of four semesters while I was writing my
          Master thesis. This was super fun and made me love teaching!

        <strong>WARR Rocketry at the TUM</strong><br />
        <p>
          I worked with students across different engineering disciplines
          (mechanical-, chemical-, aerospace-engineering, computer science and
          physics) on the development of a 5 m long hybrid-fuel based rocket.
          More specifically, I automated tasks in Python and helped in moulding
          the propellant grain into a 3D printed form inside the main chamber.
          While my contributions in that short period were little, I still
          enjoyed and learned a lot from watching the eager students working on
          their passion.

        <h3>Bachelor of Science at the LMU Munich</h3>
        <p>
          I wrote my Bachelor thesis in experimental particle physics on the
          topic "Studies of Interpolation Techniques in the Parameter Space of
          Signal Models for (BSM/SUSY) Searches". The motivation for my thesis
          was the following: simulating collision events at the LHC is
          computationally expensive. In my studies, I investigated the
          feasibility of interpolating between existing signal events by testing
          different interpolation algorithms. For a more detailed explanation,
          you can read my thesis <a href="thesis/">here</a>.

        <h3>Guest Service Agent on the MSC Sinfonia</h3>
        <p>
          After the civil service and before starting university, I briefly
          worked as a receptionist on the Italian Cruise Ship, MSC Sinfonia.
          This was a very valueable experience for me. Not only was I able to
          visit a lot of countries in Europe, but I also learned much about
          customer service and how to keep my cool when being confronted with
          complaints in four different languages.

          I completed the civil service at the LKH Gmunden hospital in Gmunden,
          near my home-town in Austria.

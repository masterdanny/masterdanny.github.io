        <p>
          I am currently working as a Systems Engineer on the development of electron-beam based metrology tools for the semiconductor industry. 
          
          <br><br> As a systems engineer, I am responsible for maintaining a complex system and ensure that the system as a whole continues to function as intended. This can be a challenging task, as it requires me to constantly monitor the system for any issues that may arise. Additionally, I must be proactive in addressing potential problems before they can cause any damage to the system.
          Another big part of my work involves conducting experiments for customer demonstrations and analyzing the data gathered from those experiments. Not only is this data used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system to the customer, but it is also used to optimize the tool's performance further by applying some needed hardware changes.

        <h3>Master of Science</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2018 - 2021</div>
        <p>
          I completed my Master's degree in physics at the Nano-Institute at the LMU Munich, where I used Machine Learning for the inverse design of achromatic metalenses. Compared to conventional optical lenses, metalenses can be made ultrathin since they are made up of nanostructures, which can be manufactured with already existing micro-fabrication techniques from the semiconductor industry. <br>
          In a second project, I fabricated chiral metamaterials and later on deposited perovskites to observe whether the perovskite-specific emission changed through the interaction of the metamaterials. It was here during the fabrication of these nanostructures in the cleanroom, that I was introduced to typical semiconductor industry processes and tools.

          <strong>Teaching Assistance at the LMU Munich.</strong> <br>
          I supervised lab courses for bachelor students in physics, medicine and dentistry over the course of four semesters while writing my Master thesis. This was super fun and made me love teaching.

        <h3>Bachelor of Science</h3>
        <div class="timespan">2015 - 2018</div>
        <p>
          I wrote my Bachelor thesis in experimental particle physics on the topic "Studies of Interpolation Techniques in the Parameter Space of Signal Models for (BSM/SUSY) Searches". <br /> 
          Simulating collision events is computationally expensive. In my studied I investigated the feasibility to interpolate between signal events by testing different interpolation algorithms.
